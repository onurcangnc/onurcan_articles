Hello everyone! About a week ago, I started working on a new idea that turned into a project I now call **NucAIScan**. Initially, I had no plans to build anything related to offensive security or cyber threat intelligence since my main focus was preparing for the **eWPTX exam**. But sometimes, inspiration shows up when you least expect it.  

During a holiday break, a bug bounty friend of mine said:  

> ‚ÄúIf we could automate scanners like Acunetix for large scopes, we could literally earn rewards just by running them and submitting the results.‚Äù  

He wasn‚Äôt wrong. He had already earned around $5,000 through this hybrid approach. That made me think:  
- Could I create a scanner that isn‚Äôt just fast, but actually smarter?  
- Could AI reduce the noise traditional tools often produce?  
- Could this pipeline serve not only bug bounty hunters, but also pentesters and researchers?  

That conversation sparked what later became **NucAIScan**.

## How NucAIScan Works (High-Level)  
At a glance, the pipeline follows these steps:  

1. **Recon:** Subfinder collects subdomains, httpx checks which ones are alive, and Subzy tests for takeover risks.  
2. **Endpoint Discovery:** FFUF fuzzes hidden paths and filters out noise using a warm-up phase and word-count clustering.  
3. **AI-Driven Template Selection:** Signals from headers, body content, and paths are fed to an AI that narrows down the most relevant Nuclei templates.  
4. **Scanning:** Nuclei runs with those templates, with ‚Äúexposures‚Äù included as a fallback.  
5. **Reporting:** Results are compiled into a color-coded HTML report (critical = red, high = orange, low = green).  

So the flow is basically:  
**Recon ‚Üí Discovery ‚Üí AI Selection ‚Üí Scan ‚Üí Report**

## Engineering the Tool  
I didn‚Äôt want NucAIScan to be ‚Äújust another script.‚Äù I designed it to be **modular, extensible, and maintainable**, following principles like single responsibility and separation of concerns.  

**Key modules include:**  
- `SubdomainScanner` ‚Üí Handles discovery (Subfinder, httpx, Subzy).  
- `FFUFScanner` ‚Üí Performs fuzzing and noise reduction.  
- `NucleiScanner` ‚Üí Executes scans with both manual and AI-selected templates.  
- `AISelector` ‚Üí Decides which templates are most relevant.  
- `ReportGenerator` ‚Üí Produces clean HTML reports.  
- `Logger & Utils` ‚Üí Core utilities for consistent handling.  

This modularity ensures changes in one area don‚Äôt break the others.

## Features in Action  
- **Smart Recon:** Subfinder + httpx + Subzy in under 10 seconds.  
- **Noise Reduction:** Warm-up runs detect junk responses, and clustering filters duplicates.  
- **AI Template Selection:** Instead of brute forcing thousands of Nuclei templates, AI narrows it down.  
- **Fallback Safety:** Exposures/ templates are always included as backup.  
- **Clean Reports:** Easy-to-read HTML output, color-coded by severity.

## Usage Examples  

### Full Scan
```bash
python -m ffufai target.com
```

### Backend Override (PHP only)
```bash
python -m ffufai target.com --backend php
```

### AI Mode
```bash
python -m ffufai target.com --ai
```

### Backend + AI Combined
```bash
python -m ffufai target.com --backend wordpress --ai
```

## Lessons Learned  
Building NucAIScan was more challenging than simply chaining tools together. Some lessons:  
- **Subprocess handling** across multiple tools was tricky.  
- **JSON parsing issues** required fallback logic.  
- **AI sanitization:** OpenAI outputs weren‚Äôt always clean JSON, so validation was required.  
- **Concurrency control:** Early versions spawned too many workers; limiting to 5 gave the best balance.  
- **Ethics:** I limited tests to my own domains and safe scopes.

## What‚Äôs Next  
- Smarter AI triage (false-positive reduction & severity scoring).  
- Docker support for easier deployment.  
- ElasticSearch integration for centralized result storage.

## Conclusion  
For me, NucAIScan became more than just a technical exercise. What started as a holiday chat turned into a tool I now use in my own workflows. It‚Äôs not meant to replace large commercial scanners, but rather serve as a lightweight companion for pentesters, researchers, and bug bounty hunters.  

If you try it out, I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback. Thanks for joining me on this experiment of blending **AI with offensive security**.
