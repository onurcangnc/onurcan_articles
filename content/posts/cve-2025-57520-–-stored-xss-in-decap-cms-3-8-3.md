## Vulnerability Summary

* **Vulnerability Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
* **Affected Versions:** Decap CMS <= 3.8.3  
* **Affected Component:** Admin Panel → Content Preview Renderer (title, tags, description, body)  
* **Impact:** Session hijacking, credential theft, arbitrary JavaScript execution in privileged user context  
* **Discoverer:** Onurcan Genç – [Independent Security Researcher](https://portfolio.onurcangenc.com.tr)

## Scenario Flow

1. **Contributor (low privilege)** injects a malicious payload into a blog entry.  
2. **Editor/Admin (high privilege)** later opens the entry in the preview panel.  
3. The payload executes in the privileged user’s browser context.  

> The vulnerability was verified under both *contributor* and *editor* roles.
> The most severe impact is observed when an **admin user** views the malicious entry in preview mode, leading to stored XSS execution in the privileged context.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

### Payload Example

```html
"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
```

## Two Step Description

1. Contributor creates malicious entry
2. Admin opens preview and XSS payload executes

## Impact

Possible consequences include:

* Session hijacking  
* Credential theft  
* Content defacement  
* Injection of backdoors into statically generated websites
