### Description

A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the login functionality of Fikir Odaları AdminPando v1.0.1. The `username` and `password` parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication completely.

Successful exploitation grants full administrative access to the application, including the ability to manipulate the public-facing website content (HTML/DOM manipulation).

---

### CVSS v3.1 Score

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Vector | `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H` |
| Base Score | **10.0 (Critical)** |
| Scope | Changed (S:C) |

**Scope: Changed (S:C) Justification:**

The vulnerability exists in the admin panel authentication (`/admin`), but successful exploitation impacts a completely separate user population mostly public website visitors.

**Attack Flow:**
1. Attacker exploits SQLi on `/admin` login page (vulnerable component)
2. Attacker gains admin dashboard access
3. Admin dashboard provides full HTML/DOM control over the public website
4. Public website visitors (impacted component) receive manipulated content

This crosses a trust boundary: unauthenticated attacker → admin privileges → impact on public users who have no interaction with the admin panel.

---

### Affected Parameters

- `username` (text input)
- `password` (password input)

---

### Proof of Concept

#### 1) Discovery

The `/admin` endpoint was discovered using directory enumeration. The login form contains two vulnerable input fields.

The application page is accessed, and the input parameters containing the vulnerability are identified.

#### 2) Exploitation

**Payload:**
```
' OR '1'='1
```

**Method:**
```
Username: ' OR '1'='1
Password: [anything]

OR

Username: [anything]
Password: ' OR '1'='1
```

(In the demonstrated scenario, only the username parameter was tested for validation purposes; however, the vulnerability is triggered across all input surfaces.)

By clicking the login button, access to the admin panel is obtained.

#### 3) Result

Authentication was bypassed successfully. Admin panel access was achieved. From the admin panel, full HTML/DOM manipulation of the public-facing website is possible, including:

- Changing homepage logo
- Modifying page content
- Full HTML/DOM control

---

### Impact

- Complete authentication bypass
- Unauthorized administrative access
- Full HTML/DOM manipulation of public website
- Malicious content distribution to visitors
- Brand/reputation damage
- Potential user data exposure
