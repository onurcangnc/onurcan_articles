### CVSS v3.1 Score

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Vector | `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H` |
| Base Score | **10.0 (Critical)** |
| Scope | Changed (S:C) |

**Scope: Changed (S:C) Justification:**

- Vulnerable component: Admin panel authentication
- Impacted component: Public-facing website

Successful exploitation grants full control over the admin panel, enabling HTML/DOM manipulation of the public website (e.g., logo, page content). This affects all site visitors beyond the vulnerable component itself.

---

### Affected Parameters

- `username` (text input)
- `password` (password input)

---

### Proof of Concept

#### 1) Discovery

The `/admin` endpoint was discovered using directory enumeration. The login form contains two vulnerable input fields.

The application page is accessed, and the input parameters containing the vulnerability are identified.

#### 2) Exploitation

**Payload:**
```
' OR '1'='1
```

**Method:**
```
Username: ' OR '1'='1
Password: [anything]

OR

Username: [anything]
Password: ' OR '1'='1
```

(In the demonstrated scenario, only the username parameter was tested for validation purposes; however, the vulnerability is triggered across all input surfaces.)

By clicking the login button, access to the admin panel is obtained.

#### 3) Result

Authentication was bypassed successfully. Admin panel access was achieved. From the admin panel, full HTML/DOM manipulation of the public-facing website is possible, including:

- Changing homepage logo
- Modifying page content
- Full HTML/DOM control

---

### Impact

- Complete authentication bypass
- Unauthorized administrative access
- Full HTML/DOM manipulation of public website
- Malicious content distribution to visitors
- Brand/reputation damage
- Potential user data exposure
